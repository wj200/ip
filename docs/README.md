## Get started
Download the .jar file of your desired version.  
Double-click and open file.  
The application is ready for use! Start adding tasks and performing other actions.  

## Here are the types of Tasks available:
* Todo
* Deadline
* Event
* Do Within *a certain time period*

## To add a Todo:
format: todo  {task name}  
*e.g. todo read book*

## To add a deadline:
format: deadline  {task name}  (by: MMM dd yyyy, h:mm a)  
*e.g. deadline return book (by: Feb 02 2024, 6:00 pm)*

## To add an Event:
format: event  {task name}  (from: MMM dd yyyy, h:mm a to MMM dd yyyy, h:mm a)  
*e.g. event CS2103T project meeting (from: Feb 28 2024, 6:00 am to: Mar 03 2024, 8:00 am)*

## To add a DoWithin, run:
format: do within  {task name}  between: MMM dd yyyy, h:mm a and MMM dd yyyy, h:mm a  
*e.g. collect certificate between: Jan 15 2024, 6:00 pm and Jan 25 2024, 6:00 pm*
